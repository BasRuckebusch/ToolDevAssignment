Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) 5th edition monster browser made for the dool development course at DAE

## Explain in short why you think this matches with the DAE / GD profile.

Choosing a D&D 5e monster API is fitting for a game developer profile because it offers access to an established game system. Manipulating and utilizing game data is a fundamental aspect of game development, and the ability to extract and incorporate data from external sources is highly valuable. Similar APIs are used internally at different studios for their own game systems.
